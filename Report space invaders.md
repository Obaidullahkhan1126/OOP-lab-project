1. Executive Summary
Overview
This project involved designing and developing a 2D arcade-style Space Invaders game using C++ and the Raylib library. The primary goal was to apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in a practical context. The project focused on implementing game components like player control, enemy movement, shooting mechanics, collision detection, and score tracking.
Key Findings
•	Successful implementation of OOP concepts in a game environment.
•	Enhanced understanding of class-based structure and object interactions.
•	Developed a functional and engaging game with essential features.




2. Introduction
Background
Games offer an engaging way to explore object-oriented programming. This project uses the classic Space Invaders format to reinforce core OOP concepts, offering learners hands-on experience in encapsulation, class hierarchies, object interactions, and modular code design.
Project Objectives
•	Develop a classic Space Invaders game clone.
•	Apply OOP principles to structure the code.
•	Use Raylib to manage graphics, sound, and input/output.
•	Build a playable version with scoring, enemy logic, and visual elements.

3. Project Description
Scope
Inclusions:
•	Player spaceship with movement and shooting.
•	Enemies with simple motion and basic AI.
•	Collision detection and explosion effects.
•	Score tracking and a game over screen.
Exclusions:
•	Multiplayer support.
•	Advanced enemy AI.
•	High scores storage or online features.
Technical Overview
•	Language: C++
•	Graphics Library: Raylib
•	Editor/IDE: Visual Studio Code
•	Version Control: Git and GitHub
•	Operating System: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux)

4. Methodology
Approach
The project followed an iterative development process. Weekly planning meetings were held to assign tasks, track progress, and troubleshoot issues. Work was divided into modules (player, enemies, bullets, UI).
Roles and Responsibilities
•	Member 1: Player class, movement, and shooting mechanics.
•	Member 2: Enemy behavior, spawning, and collision logic.
•	Member 3: UI design, score tracking, and sound integration.

5. Project Implementation
Design and Structure
•	Class-based architecture with separate files for Player, Enemy, Bullet, and Game Logic.
•	Main game loop manages updates and rendering.
•	Modular structure allows reusability and maintainability.
Functionalities Developed
•	Real-time keyboard input for player movement and firing.
•	Enemy fleet with patterned movement.
•	Bullet-enemy collision detection.
•	Sound effects and game status messages (win/lose).
•	Score display and updates.
Challenges Faced
•	Integrating Raylib with OOP architecture.
•	Ensuring smooth collision detection.
•	Debugging memory management issues in object lifecycles.
•	Balancing enemy speed and difficulty.
Resolutions:
•	Used smart pointers where necessary.
•	Stepped through code using Raylib’s debug-friendly tools.
•	Reorganized class responsibilities for better cohesion.

6. Results
Project Outcomes
•	A working and interactive Space Invaders game.
•	Clear documentation and class diagrams.
•	Full understanding of how OOP enhances game development structure.
Screenshots and Illustrations




Testing and Validation
•	Unit testing of class methods (e.g., move(), shoot()).
•	Manual playtesting across different systems.
•	Debugging via Raylib’s logging and visual feedback.


7. Conclusion
Summary of Findings
The project successfully demonstrated the integration of object-oriented programming concepts in a game development setting. It showed how modular and scalable code could be achieved using classes and structured design patterns.
Final Remarks
This project provided a valuable learning experience in applying theoretical OOP concepts in a practical scenario. Future improvements could include advanced enemy AI, UI enhancements, and additional levels for extended gameplay.
